# Talecraft Game Engine

> A game engine for playing with block-shaped voxels.

This project is currently at the beginning of it's development.

## Project Goals

> Nothing is truly set in stone except these goals.

Make it as data-driven as possible...

* No hardcoded ID's, wherever possible.
* No hardcoded gameplay elements.
* Make use of emergent systems.
* Make heavy use of CDML.

The final goal \(in the far future\) is to create the game called Talecraft.
